# Project Showcase: Building a To-Do List in Python

ðŸŒŸ Welcome to another project showcase!

## Project Overview

Our goal with this project is to build a command-line To-Do List application that allows users to manage tasks. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and view their tasks in an organized manner.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- `tabulate` module (for tabulated display)

## Project Walkthrough

**1. Add Task:**
In the project, we implemented the functionality to add tasks to our To-Do List. Users can input a task description, and it will be added to the list.

**2. Mark Task as Completed:**
Users can mark a task as completed. The task's status changes from 'âœ“' to ' ' (blank) to indicate completion.

**3. Show Tasks:**
The application also allows users to view their tasks. The tasks are displayed in a tabulated format using the `tabulate` module, enhancing the user experience.

## Challenges Faced

During development, we encountered a few challenges:

- **User Input Handling:** Ensuring that user input is correctly handled and validated was a key challenge. We had to handle cases where users might input incorrect task numbers or non-numeric values.


## Lessons Learned

Through this project, we learned:

- How to organize code using classes and methods for better readability.
- How to use external libraries like `tabulate` to enhance the display of our application.
- The importance of error handling and validation when dealing with user input.

## Next Steps

While our To-Do List is functional, there's always room for improvement! Here are a few ideas for future enhancements:

- Save tasks to a file so users can keep their tasks between sessions.
- Implement priority levels for tasks.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.

## Conclusion

ðŸŽ‰ And there you have it! A simple To-Do List application built using Python. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this project demonstrates essential concepts in programming and user interaction.
And please do not forget to leave a star.
