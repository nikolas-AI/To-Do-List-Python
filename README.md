# Project Showcase: Building a To-Do List in Python

ðŸŒŸ Welcome to another project showcase!

## Project Overview

Our goal with this project is to build a command-line To-Do List application that allows users to manage tasks. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and view their tasks in an organized manner.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- `tabulate` module (for tabulated display)

## Project Walkthrough

**1. Add Task:**
In the project, we implemented the functionality to add tasks to our To-Do List. Users can input a task description, and it will be added to the list.

**2. Mark Task as Completed:**
Users can mark a task as completed. The task's status changes from 'âœ“' to ' ' (blank) to indicate completion.

**3. Show Tasks:**
The application also allows users to view their tasks. The tasks are displayed in a tabulated format using the `tabulate` module, enhancing the user experience.

## Challenges Faced

During development, we encountered a few challenges:

- **User Input Handling:** Ensuring that user input is correctly handled and validated was a key challenge. We had to handle cases where users might input incorrect task numbers or non-numeric values.
